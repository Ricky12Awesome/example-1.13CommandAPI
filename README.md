Fixed with https://github.com/JorelAli/1.13-Command-API/issues/103

New Issue this time. no errors.

When you use version `3.1` or `3.2` it doesn't grab the source jar, or any for that matter, 
`3.0` seems to work

When trying to look for the cause, I noticed that `3.1` and `3.2` doesn't contain jars
